# PROSPECTWORX
I just started with UpWork but I am a seasoned experienced software engineer. My rate is negotiable.
I am a graduate-educated software professional with 29 years of experience in QA, development, 
and other aspects of software engineering. I have recent experience in Xcode, Swift, UAT, Selenium, 
JIRA, Jenkins, Rally, Git, Agile development with 2 week Sprints, using Postman & Fiddler to test APIs. 
I've also recently used Visual Studio, Postgresql, psql, SQL Server, Python scripting, C#, Java, black box & 
white box testing and more. I am interested in doing mobile testing using devices, simulation & cross browser 
apps (including SauceLabs & BrowserStack which I have accounts on). I am also adept at API testing using 
Postman & Fiddler. I am also extremely resourceful, multi-skilled & an Open Source aficionado.
My GitHub account contains code plus two .mp4 files which videos from  BrowserStack Python & Ruby Selenium scripts 
I wrote  and a C# Selenium program that I wrote that has the ability to connect to BrowserStack & execute. 
BrowserStack is a cross browser testing app. The bs-Python-video.mp4 & bs-Ruby-video.mp4 examples are running on my 
Mac OS X Sierra & BrowserStack in a Windows XP OS with FireFox 47.0. Both are simple browser navigation examples 
showing BrowserStackâ€™s capabilities.
